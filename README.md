# Background
I was curious how AWS makes iOS development easier. Since I have a Macbook for work, I decided out the iOS integrations.

This app uses AWS's Amplify development platform to integrate a dynamic pub/sub datastore.
This datastore offers offline synchronization and access via GraphQL. 

I followed (this)[https://docs.amplify.aws/start/q/integration/ios] tutorial.

# Next steps
Integrate a UI which lists Todos.
